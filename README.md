# Street-level-urban-heat-island-mitigation.

With the growing interest in mitigating urban heat islands (UHIs), the cooling effects of green infrastructure (GI) 
have been extensively studied. Despite its importance, there is limited exploration of how GI improves street- 
level outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) for pedestrians. This study addresses this gap by examining how urban 
greenery and water bodies help alleviate Outdoor Thermal Comfort derived Urban Heat Islands (OTC-UHIs). Our 
study results indicate that GI significantly mitigates the OTC-UHIs in hot-humid summer conditions. Highly 
developed urban areas exhibit smaller land surface temperature differences between day and night due to high 
heat capacity in buildings and pavement, creating a tropical nighttime phenomenon. GI’s cooling effects are 
greater in areas with higher vegetation cover, leading to a decrease in the OTC-UHI’s intensity, frequency, and 
duration. The relationship between OTC-UHIs and urban morphology varies throughout the day, with vegetation 
cover ratio and sky view factors impacting cooling significantly. Additionally, cooling impact distance of GI 
follows a power curve relationship, with parks having a longer cooling impact distance compared to rivers, 
particularly at night. Our findings highlight that the effective usage of GI can significantly improve the street- 
level OTC of pedestrians by tackling the climate-induced UHIs
